/**
 * Use this annotation to tell Stag that a member variable
 * or a class should be processed.
 * <p/>
 * If a member variable of a class is annotated, Stag will
 * generate a TypeAdapter for that class. Stag does not generate
 * TypeAdapters for abstract classes.
 * <p/>
 * If the class is generic (class A), but there is a concrete
 * class (class B) that has annotated members, Stag will generate
 * a TypeAdapter for the concrete class (class B) that also includes
 * all the annotated member variables declared in class A.
 * No adapter for class A will be generated.
 * <p/>
 * If a class (class B) has no annotated members, but inherits from a
 * parent class (class A) with annotated members, Stag will not know to
 * generate a TypeAdapter for that child class (class B). In that case,
 * apply the annotation to the child class declaration (class B) and
 * then Stag will know to generate a TypeAdapter for it. In this case,
 * the optional value that can be passed in the annotation will be
 * ignored as it only applies to class fields, not classes themselves.
 * <p/>
 * See the sample code for examples of each.
